DMS : Database Migration Service : 

Homogenious migration : mysql --> DMS Cluster --> mysql
Heterogenius migration : db2 --> DMS Cluster + AWS Schema Convertion tool --> AWS RDS 


DMS : SOurce connection information
Destination connection information
Launch DMS instance.. Test the connection to SOurce and destination.. 
Create a job and replicate the data
_____

Task : Launch 1 mysql rds instance... and connect to it.. import the given database.. 
Launch another mysql rds instance.. Keep it empty.. 

Using DMS migrate the database from rds instance 1 to rds instance 2.
_____

SMS : Server Migration Service : 
--> CloudEndure

What Server we want to migrate to aws, Install CLoudendure Agent --> Cloudendure screen create a task and test the connection --> Launch migration instance in AWS environment --> Run the migration task.. We will get an AMI --> Launch instance from AMI.

_____

Cloudtrail : logging service in aws environment. Enabled by defaultly, It can store last 90 days activities.. If we want to store for unlimited days, Need to "create a trail" to s3 bucket.

** Realtime : We enable trail for all accounts in one AWS Logging account. If any external auditor visits, we can provide access on only logging account.
In Real env: We create a trail for Management, another trail for data and insights.

Management events : Capture management operations performed on your AWS resources.
Data events : Log the resource operations performed on or within a resource. (Lambda, Dynamodb and S3)
Insights events : Identify unusual activity, errors, or user behavior in your account.

____

AWS COnfig : Aws config works along with Cloudtrail service.. An Inventory service in AWS environment.. 
--> We can setup Compliance standards for our AWS environemnt using Config.
Ex: 
S3 Public access buckets : Non_Compliance resource 
RDS Snapshot public : 
ACM : Expire in 14 days : 
____

AWS Trusted Advisor : Based on our AWS acount support plan trsuted advisor gives suggestions. (Basic SP / Developer SP we won;t get all trusted advisor checks).. 
--> Cost Optimization
--> Performance
--> Security
--> Fault Tolerance
--> Service Limits

Certificate Manager : Secure over http / https. : SSL/TLS

ACM : Amazon Certificate Manager : TO generate and manage the ssl/tls cert. 

TO generate an SSL/TLS cert, we need to have a Domain name, At hostedzone we need to create a record.

http to https redirection : https://raw.githubusercontent.com/avizway/redirection/master/httptohttps

____

AWS Cloudfront : AWS CDN Service (Content Delivery Network) : Akamai, cloudflair..
--> CLoudfront have a feature to protect our resources from DDoS attack.

To get the latest data from the Origin / To clear the cache from Edge location, We can perform "Invalidation".

Cache and origin request settings : Use legacy cache settings

Default TTL : 86,400 Sec (1 Day)'
Max : 365 Days

We must create SSL Cert in N Virginia to map with cloudfront distribution. 

--> Based on endcustomer geo location, we can whitelist/blocklist the data.

_____

AWS Shiled / AWS Shieled advanced : Designed to protect our resources from DDoS Attack. 

Shield Enabled for all the aws account. 
Shield advanced cost us 3000$/Month.. AWS Team monitor the DDoS attack/traffic.

___

AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall) : We can create rules in WAF and apply on top of Application Load balancer / Cloudfront / Api gateway.

___

task : Launch an ec2 instance, make it as webserver.. Launch elb, generate certificate, and map cert to elb and same domain map in Route53 and configure the http to https redirection.

AWS Inspector : It used to analyse the instance health status including OS level.
(NO FREE TIER ELIGIBILITY)..

Sprint : 2 weeks : 

Inspector agent need to install in our ec2 instance.. We can install manaually.. We can use Systems Manager.

Application Services : 

SNS : SImple Notifications Service : 
--> We can create a Topic, We can add subscribers (email, website endpoint, sqs, mobile). 
--> Subscriber need to confirm the subscription. 
--> Push based messaging service. 

SNS also supports Push notifications service. Works based on mobile operating systems. 

__

SQS : Simple Queue service : pull based messeging service. 
Ex: AutoScaling group works with sqs service. 


--> Standard 
At-least-once delivery, message ordering isn't preserved
At-least once delivery
Best-effort ordering

--> FIFO (Name should end with .fifo) 
First-in-first-out delivery, message ordering is preserved
First-in-first-out delivery
Exactly-once processin

Maximum message size : 256 kb  (AWS cost us based on chunks)
1 chunk = 64 kb..   

1 million req under free tier eligibility.

__________

SES : Simple Email Service : If we want to send messeges on behalf of another email / domain name, We can use SES service.
