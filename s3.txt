S3 : Simple Storage Service : Object Based storage : Amazon Version of Google Drive

Object Based Storage : We can store the objects, We cannot install any OS, We cannot run any programs. : S3
Block Based Storage : THis is designed to run OS / Programs. : EBS, Instance Store
Storage Over Network : (SAN/ NAS) : RUns over the network and shares to the network running resources.  --> EFS , FSx


--> We store data in Buckets.
--> Bucket = FOlder/Dir with Unique namespace.
--> We have Unlimited data in S3.
--> No Pre-Provisioning required. Pay-as-you-go.

Bucket Naming rules: 
--> Bucket name should be unique.
--> Min Char : 3, Max 63 Char
--> No Capital Letters, No Special Char
--> Should contains .  numbers, Hypens.
--> No Adjesent ..
--> Should not start with . / should not end with .
--> Should not resemble IP Address format. (192.168.0.100)

--> We can upload objects to the s3 bucket.
--> Min Object size 0 bytes.. Max Size 5 TB.

--> S3/IAM is global service, Does not required any region selection.

--> We can create Max of 1000 buckets per account, Soft limit is 100. Raise support ticket to increase the bucket limit.

Standard Object URL : 
https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/avinash.1231/iam.txt
https://s3.regioncode.amazonaws.com/bucketname/objectname

Virtual path : Works when we don;t have . in the bucket name
https://avinash.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/iam.txt
https://bucketname.s3.regioncode.amazonaws.com/objectname

Block all public access : On .. If we want to make any data puboic accesable, We need to turn this off first, Then edit the object level settings.

Versioning : Keeps track/monitor changes on objects.
--> If we accidentally delete the object, we can get the object back.
--> We will have current versioned object and previous verisoned objects.
--> When we delete Latest/cusrrent version object we will get Delete Marker. Delete the Delete marker to get the object back. (Version : hide)
--> TO get the object back, Set "Version : Show", Then delete the Delete Marker.
--> For Previous versioned objects, If we delete, we don;t get any Delete marker.

permanently delete : Objects permanently deletes
delete : It will gives us Delete Marker.

Cross Region Replication (Crr) / Same region replication (srr) :  
--> Source bucket and destination bucket shoud enable with versioning.
--> Be fore enable, Replication whatever the data we have it won't replicate to destination bucket. (Onetime, We can perform copy and paste/ Run "Sync" command)

Tags : Metadata for the resources.

Server Access Logging : If you want to enable logging on individual bucket.
