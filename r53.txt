Route53 : AWS DNS (Domain Naming System/service) Service : Maps the FQDN Name to IP Address and IP address to Fully Qualified Domain Name.

R53 used to map domain names to AWS resources (i.e; ec2, s3 static website, elb, benastalk, cloudfront)

DOmain Name : We can get a Domain name from Domain Registrers.  GoDaddy, bigrock, Freenom, aws r53..

FreeNom : GIves us a free domain name.

Step 1 : Create a HostedZone in AWS Environment.  (hostedzone name = Domain Domain)
When we create HostedZOne, We will get 2 Records.. NS (name Server) and SOA (Start of Authority)

NS Records need to be configured at Domain Registrer..  Then only domain traffic comes AWS environment.


A Record : Address Record :   DOmain Name <--> IP Address
Alias Record : AWS Owned Record : Intelligent record. it detect changes happening in backend.

--> In AWS, We always use A record along with the Alias Record.

MX Record : Mail Exchange record
CNAME : Cananical Name
TXT Record : Text Record
PTR Record : pointer Record
