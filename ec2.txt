ec2 : Elastic compute cloud : 

Azure VM = GCP Engine = Virtual Machine = server = box = ec2 Instance

Pay-as-you-go : 

server = Unpredictable = choose a server -> upgrade / downgrade

Vertical scaling or horizontal scaling : easy
________

On-Demand ec2 intances : When we don't have predictable workload, resource utilisation.. Then we can choose this on-demand instances. When we testing our application for the first time..!!
Pricing : /Sec (with Min of 60 Sec).. /hr

Reserved instances (RI) : When we have stable and predictable workload, When we decided to use the resource for longer duration..!!
Duration : 1 Yr / 3 yrs
	Standard RI : We cannot change the configuration.
	Convertable RI : We can upgrade the configuration.
	Scheduled RI : repeated resquests/persistent requests.. (N Virginia)

Pricing : all/Full Upfront : Pay full amount. No monthly charges.
	  Partial Upfront : Pay 30-50 amount now. Pay amount monthly basis with redused 		hourly price.
	  No Upfront : Pay everything monthly basis only.

--> If you changed your mind after purchasing reserved instance, we can sell these instances in AWS Marketplace.


Spot Instances : We need to bid agaist aws pricing. If we have flexible start/stop duration, If we are looking for high configuration instances for low prices.  IF aws spot price is equal / less than your quoted price, aws will allocate an ec2 instance.
--> If price increased, aws terminate our ec2 instance.

--> 1 hr 30 Min : AWS Price Increased and AWS terminated instance, We get charged for only 1 Hr.
--> 1 hr 30 Min : AWS Price Not Increased and YOU terminated instance, We get charged for only 1 Hr 30 min.


___

ec2 is a region specific service : 
Mumbai & N Virginia

__


General Purpose : Stable/balanced performance of compute, memory and network resources.
Type : t2, t3, m5

Compute Optimized : We will get more CPU performances from these instances. We will have high perf processors in these instances.
Type : c4, c5, c6  (Compute / CPU)

Memory Optimized : We will get more RAM perf. Workloads required to process large set of data via memory.
Type : r4, r5, r6, x1, z1 (RAM)

GPU Optimized / Accelerated computing : We will get more graphic processings, Efficient for data pattern matching, High level gaming.
Type : p2, p3, p4, g3, g4, f1

Storage optimized : we will get more Storage/ Hard Disk performance. FOr the application required more IOPS, we use this types.
Type : d2, d3, i3


AWS Free Tier : 
750 Hrs per Month with t2.micro for windows Instance
750 Hrs per Month with t2.micro for Linux Instance
