ec2 : Elastic compute cloud : 

Azure VM = GCP Engine = Virtual Machine = server = box = ec2 Instance

Pay-as-you-go : 

server = Unpredictable = choose a server -> upgrade / downgrade

Vertical scaling or horizontal scaling : easy
________

On-Demand ec2 intances : When we don't have predictable workload, resource utilisation.. Then we can choose this on-demand instances. When we testing our application for the first time..!!
Pricing : /Sec (with Min of 60 Sec).. /hr

Reserved instances (RI) : When we have stable and predictable workload, When we decided to use the resource for longer duration..!!
Duration : 1 Yr / 3 yrs
	Standard RI : We cannot change the configuration.
	Convertable RI : We can upgrade the configuration.
	Scheduled RI : repeated resquests/persistent requests.. (N Virginia)

Pricing : all/Full Upfront : Pay full amount. No monthly charges.
	  Partial Upfront : Pay 30-50 amount now. Pay amount monthly basis with redused 		hourly price.
	  No Upfront : Pay everything monthly basis only.

--> If you changed your mind after purchasing reserved instance, we can sell these instances in AWS Marketplace.


Spot Instances : We need to bid agaist aws pricing. If we have flexible start/stop duration, If we are looking for high configuration instances for low prices.  IF aws spot price is equal / less than your quoted price, aws will allocate an ec2 instance.
--> If price increased, aws terminate our ec2 instance.

--> 1 hr 30 Min : AWS Price Increased and AWS terminated instance, We get charged for only 1 Hr.
--> 1 hr 30 Min : AWS Price Not Increased and YOU terminated instance, We get charged for only 1 Hr 30 min.


___

ec2 is a region specific service : 
Mumbai & N Virginia

__


General Purpose : Stable/balanced performance of compute, memory and network resources.
Type : t2, t3, m5

Compute Optimized : We will get more CPU performances from these instances. We will have high perf processors in these instances.
Type : c4, c5, c6  (Compute / CPU)

Memory Optimized : We will get more RAM perf. Workloads required to process large set of data via memory.
Type : r4, r5, r6, x1, z1 (RAM)

GPU Optimized / Accelerated computing : We will get more graphic processings, Efficient for data pattern matching, High level gaming.
Type : p2, p3, p4, g3, g4, f1

Storage optimized : we will get more Storage/ Hard Disk performance. FOr the application required more IOPS, we use this types.
Type : d2, d3, i3


AWS Free Tier : 
750 Hrs per Month with t2.micro for windows Instance
750 Hrs per Month with t2.micro for Linux Instance

Step 1 : Choose an AMI (Amazon Machine Image) 		: OS  Win 2016 base

Step 2: Choose an Instance Type				: t2.micro (1 vCPU, 1 RAM)

Step 3: Configure Instance Details

Shutdown behavior : What happens when we initiate shutdown from os levl. : STOP/Terminate
Enable termination protection : Protect instance from accidental termination. : yes

Step 4: Add Storage

	WIndows : root : COntains OS : 30 Gb

Step 5: Add Tags : We can add max of 50 tags. Key and Value pair.

Name = 
Platform = Windows / linux
Cost Center = AAZAA
Application = 
Owner/poc = 

Step 6: Configure Security Group : Firewall at OS level. (0-65535)

Linux : ssh : Secure shell : 22	--> TO connect to Linux Server
Windows : RDP : Remote desktop protocol : 3389 --> To connect to Windows Server
http : Webserver : 80
https : Secure over http : 443
mssql : Microsoft sql : 1433
mysql : oracle mysql : 3306

Step 7 : Review and Launch with Keypair.

Public Key : it store with AWS. Instance will store this.
Private Key : It is with us. We need to browse the private keypair to get the initial password. (.pem)


Default Username and Password..??? 
Un : Administrator
pwd : We get the password from the keypair.

Public IP : Unique across the globe.  
Private IP : Unique within the network. Internal communication. 

option 1 : run --> mstsc --> enter 
option 2 : goto windows --> search for "remote desktop connection"
option 3 : Download the mstsc file from console, open it, enter the password.



Stop : We can stop the instance, when required you can start the instance and you can continue thw work.
Terminate : Deleting instance completely.

How to the instance type..? 
--> We need to stop the instance first, then we can change the instance type.
We takes weekly maintenance window, then we perform such type of operations.


ec2 instance isolation process..!!

Hostbased hypervisor : Vmware workstation, oracle virtualbox, kvm 
Bare metal hypervisor (type 1 hypervisor): ecxi, hyper-v, xen, nitro

Tenancy : 
--> Shared tenancy (Default tenancy) : Underlying hardware shares with multiple customers ec2 instances.
--> Dedicated Tenancy : underlying hardware will not share with any other customer. Dedicated to our aws resources.
	--> Dedicated Instance : 
	--> Dedicated Host : Visibility of sockets, cores, host ID.. 


Task : Launch windows server 2016 base, Login to the ec2 instance and change the password. Logout from the ec2 instance.. Try to connect ec2 instance using the keypair pwd..!!! 

Task 2 : Create a local user, provide rdp permisisons to get connect to the instance, provide the local admin rights also.. When administrator session is active, try to connect as newly created user.
