ec2 : Elastic compute cloud : 

Azure VM = GCP Engine = Virtual Machine = server = box = ec2 Instance

Pay-as-you-go : 

server = Unpredictable = choose a server -> upgrade / downgrade

Vertical scaling or horizontal scaling : easy
________

On-Demand ec2 intances : When we don't have predictable workload, resource utilisation.. Then we can choose this on-demand instances. When we testing our application for the first time..!!
Pricing : /Sec (with Min of 60 Sec).. /hr

Reserved instances (RI) : When we have stable and predictable workload, When we decided to use the resource for longer duration..!!
Duration : 1 Yr / 3 yrs
	Standard RI : We cannot change the configuration.
	Convertable RI : We can upgrade the configuration.
	Scheduled RI : repeated resquests/persistent requests.. (N Virginia)

Pricing : all/Full Upfront : Pay full amount. No monthly charges.
	  Partial Upfront : Pay 30-50 amount now. Pay amount monthly basis with redused 		hourly price.
	  No Upfront : Pay everything monthly basis only.

--> If you changed your mind after purchasing reserved instance, we can sell these instances in AWS Marketplace.


Spot Instances : We need to bid agaist aws pricing. If we have flexible start/stop duration, If we are looking for high configuration instances for low prices.  IF aws spot price is equal / less than your quoted price, aws will allocate an ec2 instance.
--> If price increased, aws terminate our ec2 instance.

--> 1 hr 30 Min : AWS Price Increased and AWS terminated instance, We get charged for only 1 Hr.
--> 1 hr 30 Min : AWS Price Not Increased and YOU terminated instance, We get charged for only 1 Hr 30 min.

Step 1 : Choose an AMI (Amazon Machine Image) 		: OS  Win 2016 base

Step 2: Choose an Instance Type				: t2.micro (1 vCPU, 1 RAM)

Step 3: Configure Instance Details

Shutdown behavior : What happens when we initiate shutdown from os levl. : STOP/Terminate
Enable termination protection : Protect instance from accidental termination. : yes

Step 4: Add Storage

	WIndows : root : COntains OS : 30 Gb

Step 5: Add Tags : We can add max of 50 tags. Key and Value pair.

Name = 
Platform = Windows / linux
Cost Center = AAZAA
Application = 
Owner/poc = 

Step 6: Configure Security Group : Firewall at OS level. (0-65535)

Linux : ssh : Secure shell : 22	--> TO connect to Linux Server
Windows : RDP : Remote desktop protocol : 3389 --> To connect to Windows Server
http : Webserver : 80
https : Secure over http : 443
mssql : Microsoft sql : 1433
mysql : oracle mysql : 3306

Step 7 : Review and Launch with Keypair.

Public Key : it store with AWS. Instance will store this.
Private Key : It is with us. We need to browse the private keypair to get the initial password. (.pem)


Default Username and Password..??? 
Un : Administrator
pwd : We get the password from the keypair.

Public IP : Unique across the globe.  
Private IP : Unique within the network. Internal communication. 

option 1 : run --> mstsc --> enter 
option 2 : goto windows --> search for "remote desktop connection"
option 3 : Download the mstsc file from console, open it, enter the password.



Stop : We can stop the instance, when required you can start the instance and you can continue thw work.
Terminate : Deleting instance completely.

How to the instance type..? 
--> We need to stop the instance first, then we can change the instance type.
We takes weekly maintenance window, then we perform such type of operations.


ec2 instance isolation process..!!

Hostbased hypervisor : Vmware workstation, oracle virtualbox, kvm 
Bare metal hypervisor (type 1 hypervisor): ecxi, hyper-v, xen, nitro

Tenancy : 
--> Shared tenancy (Default tenancy) : Underlying hardware shares with multiple customers ec2 instances.
--> Dedicated Tenancy : underlying hardware will not share with any other customer. Dedicated to our aws resources.
	--> Dedicated Instance : 
	--> Dedicated Host : Visibility of sockets, cores, host ID.. 


Task : Launch windows server 2016 base, Login to the ec2 instance and change the password. Logout from the ec2 instance.. Try to connect ec2 instance using the keypair pwd..!!!

Task 2 : Create a local user, provide rdp permisisons to get connect to the instance, provide the local admin rights also.. When administrator session is active, try to connect as newly created user. 

_______________________________________________________________________________________

D: 30/04/2021

Security Group : SG are firewall at Instance level.

Inbound rules and Outbound rules. 
--> We need to takes care about the inbound rules.

--> Only we can allow the traffic using SGs. We don't have deny option.

myip : Picks currently connected network public ip address. 
** --> CHangs to the SG takes effect immediately. 

Within the ec2 instance we can use loop back ip address : 
http://localhost/ http://127.0.0.1

--> From outside world, use Public Ip address to access the webserver.

C:\inetpub\wwwroot : Public document root path.. Place your webpages in this location.

___________

EIP : Elastic IP Address : Dedicated IP address for our resources. 
** NO FREE TIER ELIGIBILITY.

ENI : Elastic Network Interface : 
--> Ec2 instance and ENI should be in same AZ. Then only we can associate eni with instance. 

__________

Monitoring ec2 instance : 
--> CLoudwatch is the dedicated service to monitor all aws resources.
--> 2 types of monirotings
	--> Basic Monitoring : Graphs refresh with 5 Min interval
	--> Detailed / Enhanced Monitoring : Graphs refresh with 1 Min interval
--> We can monitor CPU, Network, Disk but not Memory resource/utilization.
--> If we want to monitor Memory/RAM utilisation, We need to run Cloudwatch agent with in the ec2 instance, it generates the custom metrics.

Req: WHen CPU utilisation is 90% or more for 15 minutes.. I want to reboot the ec2 instance.

________

Status Check on ec2 instance :

--> Instance status checks : Instance health status. : reboot 
--> System Status check : Health Status of hardware/host. : Stop and Start the instance.
	(When we perform stop/start option, Instance look for healthy hardware. If it detects any issues on existing hardware, it migrates to another h/w automatically.)

We need to make newly added volume available at OS level.

run --> diskmgmt.msc --> Make "online", "Initialise disk", Write File System.

OS : FAT, FAT 32, NTFS, ReFS
Linux : ect3, ext4, xfs
__

Increase the size of an Existing volume..??
--> First increase size in Console, Then Increase at OS level.

__

VOlume 1 is with Instance 1.. Same volume required for Instance 2..!!! 
--> Yes, It's possible.. But Both the Instances should be in Same AZ.

__

1a-instance and 1b-instance.. 1a instance volume need to detach and it should attach to 1b-instance.. (Our instances are running in different AZs)..!!

Choose the Volume --> Create a Backup (snapshot) --> Create a volume in desired AZ.

Snapshot : Backup copy of our EBS volume.

__

Instance-1 is in Mumbai Region.. Instance-2 is in Another Region..!!!

Choose the Volume --> Create a Backup (snapshot) --> COpy the snapshot to desired region --> Create a volume in desired Regions AZ.

__

Instance-1 is in Account-1... Instance-2 is in Account-2...!!!! 

Choose the Volume --> Create a Backup (snapshot) --> Choose "Modify permissions" option, Provide the 12 digit aws account id-2 thn Save --> Find the snapshot in account-2 region --> Create a volume in desired Regions AZ.

____

You have a volume, that volume you want to share with everyone who have an aws account..!!

Choose the Volume --> Create a Backup (snapshot) --> Choose "Modify permissions" option, select "Public" --> Save

________________

Can we decrease the size of an EBS volume..??
Ans : NO.. Only increase is possible.

_________________________________________________________________________________

Task : Launch an ec2 instance, Make it as webserver, test the output using Public IP address.

Task 2 : Launch an ec2 instance in ap-south-1a... Another ec2 instance in ap-south-1b..
Create a volume in ap-south-1a.. Attach it to 1a instance and make it available.. Write some data into it..
Make Same volume available to 1b instance..!!

snapshots : 
--> AWS uses s3 platform to store the snapshots. (We cannot find these snapshots in our s3 buckets).
--> Snpashots are point-in-time copies.


DLM : Data Lifecycle Manager : To automate the Snapshot creation for our ebs volumes. 
--> We can take backup of individual ebs volumes / Instances.
--> We cannot share the default encryption snapshots with any aws acocunts/ we cannot make it public.
--> If we have a snapshot with CMK (Customer managed keys), We can share it with Another AWS account user.. But you need to share the Customer managed ebcryption keys. We cannot make it public.
